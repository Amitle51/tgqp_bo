## Overview

Standard Gaussian Processes (GPs) are the default surrogate model in Bayesian Optimization, but they implicitly assume an unconstrained target space. In many real-world optimization problems, the objective function has a known maximum — a global bound that standard GP-based BO ignores entirely.

This project introduces **TGQP-BO**, a Bayesian Optimization framework built on a novel surrogate model: the **Truncated Gaussian Quasi-Process (TGQP)**. TGQPs extend GPs to handle known global bounds by truncating the joint Gaussian distribution to a convex constraint set. Due to the probabilistic nature of a truncated space, TGQPs are defined only on a fixed set of evaluation locations — a formulation known as **transductive inference**.

The framework demonstrates improved sample efficiency in Bayesian Optimization when the objective function's maximum is known — not only compared to standard unconstrained GP-based BO, but also compared to methods specifically designed for known-bound settings, including approaches that incorporate the bound directly into the surrogate via a GP transformation, or into the acquisition function design.

## Key Contributions

- **Truncated Gaussian Quasi-Process (TGQP)** — a principled surrogate model for black-box functions with known global bounds, formalized as a transductive model on fixed evaluation grids
- **Fully Bayesian Inference** via a block MCMC scheme combining:
  - **Exact Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)** for sampling constrained latent vectors, implemented via the R package `hdtg`
  - **Double Metropolis-Hastings (DMH)** updates for hyperparameter inference, addressing doubly-intractable normalizing constants
- **Convexity-preserving finite-dimensional interpolation** for scalable inference while maintaining global constraints throughout
- **BO integration** — experiments show that pairing the TGQP surrogate with the Max-value Entropy Search (MES) acquisition function yields the best performance

> **Note on runtime:** Due to the DMH inference step, fitting the TGQP model is slower than traditional MLE-based methods. However, the runtime remains negligible relative to the cost of evaluating the black-box objective — which is precisely the setting this framework is designed for.

## Installation

### Step 1 — Prerequisites (R + hdtg)

The TGQP inference engine uses Harmonic Monte Carlo sampling implemented in R, accessed from Python via `rpy2`. You must install R and the `hdtg` package before installing the Python dependencies.

**1. Install R 4.4.3**  
Download from: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.4.3/

**2. Install Rtools (Windows only)**  
Required to compile R packages with C++ components:  
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

**3. Install the `hdtg` R package (version 0.2.1)**  
Run the following in your terminal:
```bash
Rscript -e "install.packages('https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/hdtg/hdtg_0.2.1.tar.gz', repos=NULL, type='source')"
```

### Step 2 — Python Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Amitle51/tgqp_bo
cd tgqp_bo

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Python version:** 3.10.19

## Reproducing the Experiments

The experiment scripts in `known_opt_bo/experiments/` compare TGQP-BO against baseline BO methods. To reproduce the experiments, you will additionally need the **BABO** framework set as a source root in your project.

**BABO** is an open-source Bayesian Optimization benchmarking framework available at:  
https://github.com/HanyangHenry-Wang/BABO

Clone BABO and add it as a source root in your IDE (or add it to your `PYTHONPATH`) before running the experiment scripts.

## Scope

This implementation focuses on **1D black-box optimization problems with a known maximum**. While fully functional and experimentally validated in this setting, the framework is also designed with extensibility in mind — it can be viewed as a foundation for higher-dimensional problems, where the core ideas of constraint-aware surrogate modeling and transductive inference remain applicable.
